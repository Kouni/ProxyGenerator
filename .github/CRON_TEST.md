## GitHub Actions Schedule Status

The workflow should run every hour at minute 0 (UTC).

### Troubleshooting GitHub Actions Cron

If scheduled workflows stop running:

1. Check repository activity - GitHub disables scheduled workflows for inactive repos
2. Manually trigger the workflow to reactivate it
3. Ensure the repository has had commits in the last 60 days
4. Check GitHub Actions settings in repository settings

### Manual Trigger

Use the "Actions" tab in GitHub and click "Run workflow" to manually trigger.
